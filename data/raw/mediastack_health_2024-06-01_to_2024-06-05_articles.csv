An appeal is possible, but for now it appears patients can receive the pills through pharmacies — prescribed through a health care practitioner other than a doctor — and take them at home. The judge upheld requirements of in-person consultations 72 hours in...",https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/us-government/3369728/federal-judge-blocks-some-rules-on-abortion-pills-in-north-carolina.html,mymotherlode,,general,en,us,2024-06-04T22:16:54+00:00,health

They say growing insurance complications, doctor and drug shortages and a lack of communication all make life harder for anyone dealing with a serious or chronic illness. Outside care, help with the rent or utility bills also may be harder for patients to find. More care providers and employers are offering help guiding people through care, a practice the federal Medicare program has started to cover.
